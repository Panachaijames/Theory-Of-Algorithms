## The reason for making this repository
This repository exists to contain my project for Theory of Algorithm module. This repository will shows my attempt to solve three different type of problem using Python. 

The problem
- The Post Correspondence Problem
- The Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
- The Countdown Numbers Game

## This repository contain
- <b> countdown.ipynb </b>
  - Overview and explanation of the countdown number game
  - Python function to solve the game
  - Example, test of the function

- <b>post-correspondence.ipynb</b>
  -  Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem
  -  Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem
  -  Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
  -  Explanation on undecidable problem.

## How To Open The Notebook

1. Download Anaconda.
2. Make sure git is installed.
3. Create and Open a blank folder on your computer
4. Open cmd in your folder.
5. Clone the repository, using the command git clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Panachaijames/Theory-Of-Algorithms.git
```
6. Open the folder in cmd
```bash
cd Theory-Of-Algorithms
```
7. Run the notebooks using either command (lab or notebook)

```bash
| jupyter notebook | jupyter lab |
```
8. Jupyter should run in browser, if not the localhost address should be provided in the command prompt where you can copy and paste into your required search engine.
9. You can restart and run all cells in either the 'countdown.ipynb' or 'post-correspondence.ipynb' notebooks.

System requirements that are needed to run the project includes:
